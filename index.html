        <p>Hi! I am a research assistant at Tsinghua University working on machine learning with 
            <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/hangzhao/">Prof. Hang Zhao</a>. </p>
            <p><b>Email:</b> patrickhua.ty@gmail.com</p>

        <h3 id="research">Research</h3>
        <p>
            I aim to design self-supervised models that maximally and efficiently utilize the supervision from different types of datasets (visual-spatial, symbolic-combinatory) and build more generalizable AI models. 
            <br/>
            I'm also interested in the interplay between language and vision: compressing visual scenes using texts and generating images from textual inputs. 
            <br/>
            My past and current research areas of focus include self-supervised learning, visual reasoning, and generative modeling.</p>
